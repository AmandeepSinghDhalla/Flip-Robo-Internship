This repository contains the web scrapping assignment-2 using the selenium library. I have scraped various websites for 10 different questions given in the assignment. I have used Python, Time and Selenium library for the scraping and Pandas library to make data frame and save results in form of CSV file.

Please find the jupyter notebook namely 'Web Scrapping Assignment 2.ipyb' in the repository.
